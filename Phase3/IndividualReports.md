# Individual Reports

- What is your most significant individual contribution?
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

Please keep it short.

## Eugene Cheung (arkon)
- My most signification contribution was the design of the general app architecture, including the initialization and implementation of the [Sails project](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/dbd7316cd650f4504918ae0f8a563e9f2a795ea3), with the extra packages required for it to work with the PostgreSQL [database](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/346c24fa775613a07d1a1bf13f9b7ed3fcadf827) and [fixtures](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/f08710de7c07b07e648096bd17426bc60d41403f) for easier data loading.
- I learned a lot about how to use Sails during this project, as it was my first time touching it (or even knowing about it). I also learned about using [fixtures](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/tree/master/test/fixtures) to easily/automatically load data into the database, which came in very useful for development, and would also be useful for production, since we can store all the tutorial content in fixtures.
- I helped my teammates understand what the goal of the project was and guided them in the development process, both by setting up the general development environment, and providing resources to them to learn from (such as online tutorials, documentation, and example code).
- I could have divide the work more evenly and enforce deadlines to ensure better flowing development of the project.

## Sharon Hogan (hogansh)
- My most signigicant individaul contribution would be setting up the view for displaying the quizes by pulling information from the fixture [issue #5](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/5#event-237769527), as well as answer validation with post[issue #28](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/28).
- While working on the Itty Bitty, I learned how to use the framework sails.js, and the implementation of the MVC architectural pattern.
- My main strength as a team member is I always complete my assingmed task on time. My section of code often can be used in other parts of the project for other memebers as reference/template.
- My weeknesses would surely be my lack of expirences in web development, so it takes me a very long time to figure out how to complete my assigned task, which leads me to have less time to help with the rest of the project.
