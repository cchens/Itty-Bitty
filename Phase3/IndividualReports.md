## Eugene Cheung (arkon)
- My most signification contribution was the design of the general app architecture, including the initialization and implementation of the [Sails project](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/dbd7316cd650f4504918ae0f8a563e9f2a795ea3), with the extra packages required for it to work with the PostgreSQL [database](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/346c24fa775613a07d1a1bf13f9b7ed3fcadf827) and [fixtures](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/f08710de7c07b07e648096bd17426bc60d41403f) for easier data loading.
- I learned a lot about how to use Sails during this project, as it was my first time touching it (or even knowing about it). I also learned about using [fixtures](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/tree/master/test/fixtures) to easily/automatically load data into the database, which came in very useful for development, and would also be useful for production, since we can store all the tutorial content in fixtures.
- I helped my teammates understand what the goal of the project was and guided them in the development process, both by setting up the general development environment, and providing resources to them to learn from (such as online tutorials, documentation, and example code).
- I could have divide the work more evenly and enforce deadlines to ensure better flowing development of the project.
