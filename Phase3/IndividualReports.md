# Individual Reports

- What is your most significant individual contribution?
- Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
- What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
- What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)

Please keep it short.

## Ben Shaft (BShaft)
- My most signification contribution was the quiz feature of Itty Bitty. This involved displaying a tutorial's questions to the user and checking their answer ([issue #5,](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/5) [issue #28](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/28)) as well as the implementation of and update to the scoring system [(issue #9)](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/9).
- Like the other members on the team, this was my first exposure to the [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/#!/) framework. Also, in Phase-3 I was tasked with using POST to validate user answers. This was new to me as I would normally do that validation client-side because of its relative simplicity but I now understand the major benefits of using HTTP requests instead.
- I am able to quickly learn new techniques on my own and adapt to new situations. I would then help my teammates adjust to a pivot made during the planning and/or development stages or by reviewing their code with them.
- I should begin working on what I am assigned sooner. This would've let my teammates have more time to learn from or review my code and it would have given me more time to suggest and add extra features to Itty Bitty.

## Catherine Wang (nishikiw)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- My most signification contribution was making some tutorial and exercise content, displaying view of selecting page and achievements. [Commit1](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/ed8b3bd02f24a9821d5c81091c733c822252272b).[Commit2](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/84beea30853fc3af702222aa9eb305e16484164a) - Christina helped me to commit my work due to something wrong with my laptop.
- While working on the whole project, I learned Html, JavaScrip, Sails, and the main components of website.

- While working on the whole project, I learned Html, JavaScript, Sails, and the main components of website.
>>>>>>> origin/master
- I could complete whatever assigned to me on time, and I am willing to learn.
- I do not have enough knowledge and experience of building a website, I should have learned more before taking this course so I could help more in the project, and would not bother my team-mates for too many questions.

## Christina Chen (cchens)
- My most signification contribution was setting up the [Passport.js](http://passportjs.org/) authentication to include social network integration ([issue #6](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/6) and [issue #11](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/11)), as well as writing and implementing the reference sheets that compliments the tutorial content ([issue #12](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/12)).
- While working on this project, I learned how to make use of the Sails.js framework. I also learned a lot about backend web development in general, as well as how MVC works ([issue #20](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/20)).
- My main strength was that I am proactive and complete assigned issues before the deadline. I can then use the remaining time to help other team members with their work.
- My main weakness was lack of experience in web development. Where online tutorials and documentation fails to cover an issue I have, I've had to rely on asking other team members for help explaining concepts, which slows work down and takes up time for other team members.

## Eric Snyder (radical)
- My most signification contribution (for phase 3) was adding tutorial content to fixtures and implementing part of the leaderboard page (together with leebang.)
- While working on our project I learned about the Sails.js framework. Sails is helpful because it uses exclusivly javascript and doesn't require someone to learn multiple languages to work with, making it perfect for a project like this with people of varying degrees of experience in web programming.
- I am good at teamwork and always encoraged the member of my team to do their best as the scrum master.
- I could stand to improve my javascript ability as some of the code I wrote had to be corrected by people more experienced.

## Eugene Cheung (arkon)
- My most signification contribution was the design of the general app architecture, including the initialization and implementation of the [Sails project](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/dbd7316cd650f4504918ae0f8a563e9f2a795ea3), with the extra packages required for it to work with the PostgreSQL [database](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/346c24fa775613a07d1a1bf13f9b7ed3fcadf827) and [fixtures](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/f08710de7c07b07e648096bd17426bc60d41403f) for easier data loading.
- I learned a lot about how to use Sails during this project, as it was my first time touching it (or even knowing about it). I also learned about using [fixtures](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/tree/master/test/fixtures) to easily/automatically load data into the database, which came in very useful for development, and would also be useful for production, since we can store all the tutorial content in fixtures.
- I helped my teammates understand what the goal of the project was and guided them in the development process, both by setting up the general development environment, and providing resources to them to learn from (such as online tutorials, documentation, and example code).
- I could have divide the work more evenly and enforce deadlines to ensure better flowing development of the project.

## Yining Lin (leebang)
- My most significant contribution was desiging and implementing tutorial contents, as well as implementing leader board page. 
[commit](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/ac8b2a2abd8b58321345d61ece31600da3ad9442); 
[commit](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/commit/4aee179ac185690057152c2af8b9a3a4e158db7f)
- We were using a framework call Sails to build up our site. It allows us to write back end and front end using javascript, so everything is simple than ever. We use PSQL to manage data. From this project, I reviewd some part of MVC stuff, as well as javascript and JSON.
- Half of my job was deciding tutorial contents, and rest of them are implementing front end stuff, since my back-end knowledge was not strong enough.
- I am still not familiar with javascript syntax, as well as back-end construction. So most of my works were front-end related.

## Sharon Hogan (hogansh)
- My most signigicant individual contribution would be setting up the view for displaying the quizzes by pulling information from the fixtures ([issue #5](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/5#event-237769527)), as well as answer validation via POST calls ([issue #28](https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/301W15-Prj-Team1-repo/issues/28)).
- While working on the Itty Bitty, I learned how to use the Sails.js framework, and the implementation of the MVC architectural pattern.
- My main strength as a team member is I always complete my assigned task on time. My section of code often can be used in other parts of the project for other members as reference/template.
- My weaknesses would surely be my lack of experience in web development, so it takes me a very long time to figure out how to complete my assigned task, which leads me to have less time to help with the rest of the project.
