# Architecture

Itty Bitty is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) web application using the [Sails.js web framework](http://sailsjs.org/#!/). In conjunction with the web app, other notable components of the system are a PostgreSQL database (using the [sails-postgresql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails-postgresql) adapter, and loading pre-made fixtures for quicker development and loading of things like tutorial contents into the database with [barrels](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails-postgresql)) to store data along with using [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) for handling user authentication.

We decided to use Node.js + Sails.js due to the varying levels of experience with web development in our group. By doing so, we could stick with a single language across the front and back ends (JavaScript, along with other associated things like HTML, CSS, ERB, etc.). This decreased the need for group members to learn new things, so they could more easily contribute to the project, which has a fairly short timeline. This was a generally good decision, as choosing something else like Ruby on Rails would have demanded the members to learn more, but Sails is still somewhat new and lacks detailed documentation.
