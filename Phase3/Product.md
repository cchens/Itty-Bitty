# Product description

- How do you expect a typical user to use your product? (i.e. run us through a quick scenario or two).

Itty Bitty is an interactive web-based tutorial system that allows users to learn about and practice bitwise operators/arithmetic, and conversion between numerical bases (decimal, binary, and hexadecimal). The idea behind Itty Bitty stemmed from the team members' experiences with courses such as CSC258 and CSC369, where an understanding of bitwise operations and converting between different numerical bases comes in useful. For example, knowledge of manipulating bits and converting from hexadecimal to decimal is helpful for reading and modifying with file systems.

The web app features a proper backend that is hooked up to a PostgreSQL database that stores both the tutorial content and any user data. A basic tutorial system that displays tutorial content ("course material" and exercises) to users with basic answer validation was created. User accounts (local and via Twitter) are also functional, allowing users to see their information and keep track of their scores and achievements.
