# Process

Tools that our team made use of GitHub issues, Trello, and Slack. Trello was suggested by the TA, but was eventually abandoned once we started development, where GitHub issues effectively took over the same role as Trello. We regularly used Slack as a communication tool, which worked effectively since our schedules were generally difficult to coordinate to meet in person. As such, the agile-like conventions that we were meant to follow did not work very well, but we generally tried to have at least one scrum per week/sprint, along with more informal scrums (re: conversations) online.
