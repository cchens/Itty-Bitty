# Process

Tools that our team made use of GitHub issues, Trello, and Slack. Trello was suggested by the TA, but was eventually abandoned once we started development, where GitHub issues effectively took over the same role as Trello. We regularly used Slack as a communication tool, which worked effectively since our schedules were generally difficult to coordinate to meet in person. As such, the agile-like conventions that we were meant to follow did not work very well, but we generally tried to have at least one scrum per week/sprint, along with more informal scrums (re: conversations) online.

If we were to continue to work as a team, our process would likely be done via more regularly scheduled online meetings (on Slack or Skype/Hangouts, for example) in order to actually have the recommended number of scrum meetings. This would also assume that we are not all busy with other courses. We would continue to make use of the GitHub issues system as well, as it has worked fairly well.
