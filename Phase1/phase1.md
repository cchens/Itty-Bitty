##### Christina Chen
I am a third-year student at University of Toronto St. George, with a double major in computer science and biology. I first started programming in high school by self-studying Java in a (failed) attempt to take as many AP exams as possible, but didn’t seriously consider it as a career until I took CSC108 as a “bird” course at the end of first year. I’m currently a bioinformatics research assistant at the [Chang Lab](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/chang/), where I work with various algorithms to sequence genetic material more efficiently.

##### Cindy Wu
I am a third-year student at University of Toronto St. George studying for a Bachelor of Science computer science specialist, statistics major, and math minor with focus in artificial intelligence. Started programming in grade 10 when I took our high school’s Introduction to Computer Science class where we learned Java. I enjoy creating things for functionality and to simplify things as much as possible. To me, keep finding ways to change and adapt based on experiences is very important.

##### Eugene Cheung
I am a third-year student at University of Toronto St. George studying to get a Bachelor of Science with a specialization in Computer Science and a focus in Web and Internet technologies. I began teaching myself about graphic design and basic programming at the age of 12, and have loved crafting beautiful creations ever since. My passion for computer science was further fueled by taking introductory classes in secondary school. I have participated in several hackathons as part of [Team Unhaltable](http://www.unhaltable.com/) and was part of the winning team at UofTHacks 2013. I have worked on the [MarkUs Project](http://markusproject.org/) in the past and will be interning at [Infusion](http://www.infusion.com/) starting in May. I was a teaching assistant (Android specialist) for CSC207 last semester and am currently a teaching assistant for CSC318.

##### Sharon Hogan
I am Sharon Hogan in U of T third year, hoping to complete both the computer science specialist and the statistics major. My current fields of interests are machine learning and web development. I currently work for Hero Games on their website herogames.ca. My first programming language learned was Turing back in grade 9 and I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't until grade 12 that I finally decided I would want to do this as a career. So here I am, three years later taking csc301 in University of Toronto.


### Project

Itty Bitty is an interactive web-based tutorial that allows users to learn about bitwise operators, bitwise arithmetic, and conversion between numerical bases. This topic was chosen by collectively eliminating topics as a group from a list of topics our group found difficult or interesting throughout our experiences studying computer science. The particular concept of Itty Bitty stemmed from our experiences with courses such as CSC258 and CSC369, where an understanding of bitwise operations and converting between different numerical bases comes in useful. The system is targeted not only at university level computer science students, but anybody who is interested in learning about these topics. Itty Bitty will be designed in such a way that anybody can begin learning about these topics with no prior knowledge. Of course, users can also skip to specific “lessons” that they are more interested in.


### Personas

**Jamming Jim** is a fairly laidback 18 year old senior high school student in Toronto interested in studying computer science in university, which stems from having taken an introductory course in the previous year and enjoys being able to solve problems through code. He enjoys playing guitar and is part of an indie band with his friends, occasionally playing small gigs at local bars. Since he considers himself to be a fairly average student, Jim is preparing himself for university by using various online tools to learn more related content alongside his high school courses. Alongside more school-like resources such as Coursera or Udemy, Jim enjoys learning about new things through interactive websites such as Itty Bitty, which allows him to learn about bitwise operations and conversion between numerical bases (such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal), despite having no prior knowledge in these specific topics. While he generally doesn’t enjoy classes, Jim thinks online learning tools work fairly well and he can firmly grasp the material by being more hands-on with the tutorials. As such, he thinks he can improve his grades in high school and do well in post-secondary school, with high hopes for the future.

**Studious Sarah** is a third year university student attending University of Texas at Austin. Sarah commutes to and from school every day. Asides from studying computer science for school, Sarah also plays baseball on the varsity team. On the way to school, Sarah uses her iPad to catch up on schoolwork and 


### User Stories

As Jim, I want to learn more through interactive online tutorials via a truly hands-on approach with the actual material so I can learn more about the things I’m interested in.
