# The Product

Itty Bitty is an interactive web-based tutorial system that allows users to learn about and practice bitwise operators/arithmetic, and conversion between numerical bases (decimal, binary, and hexadecimal). The idea behind Itty Bitty stemmed from the team members' experiences with courses such as CSC258 and CSC369, where an understanding of bitwise operations and converting between different numerical bases comes in useful. For example, knowledge of manipulating bits and converting from hexadecimal to decimal is helpful for reading and modifying with file systems. 

Features build during this phase includes a functional web app using [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org/), complete with a proper backend that is hooked up to a PostgreSQL database that stores both the tutorial content and any user data. A basic tutorial system that displays tutorial content (material and exercises) to users with basic answer validation was created. The required menus to reach the content were added, but all user-related features (login/registration, profiles, achievements, etc.) are not yet implemented. Tutorial content was drafted, but has not been added to the database yet.
