## Sprint summaries

**Monday, February 9th**  
**Tutorial Room**  
Not an official scrum meeting as we haven't begun phase 2 yet. At our TA's request we're writing more user stories so that we can properly coordinate our scrums. We intend to coordinate the writing of these user stories on Google Docs and then push them to GitHub when they are fully complete, as we did with our phase 1. **Eric Snyder** was appointed as our scrum master, and thus is currently writing this document. We decided our first proper meeting can be on **Thursday, February 11th** when our phase 2 will be approved.

**Friday, February 13th**
**Bahen Laptop Lounge**
Planning Meeting #1

Eric, Christina - Tutorials
Catherine, Inks - Display tutorial content (3 types) & Topic selecting technology with level parameters
Ben - question asking technology with answer validation

User stories - ones highlighted above

Technologies: 
Sails.js (depends on Node.js), with PostgreSQL database
Running on a DigitalOcean server with Dokku
Tutorials stored as raw text within database?

Sprint 1:
Finish setting up server (SASS support, database)
Start drafting tutorials (1 each?)
Start prototyping tutorial system (display material, prompt for answer, validate answer, move on appropriately)


## GitHub conventions
- Each issue is roughly some feature that needed to be implemented
- Default tags are used (e.g. bug, enhancement)
- Tag for "Current sprint" used to keep track of what needed to be done during a sprint
- Milestones for Phase 2 and Phase 3 allow for more filtering
- Since GitHub only allows for 1 person to be assigned to an issue, users were simply tagged in the issue description/comments. We may switch to using tags for this next phase.


## Other tools
- GitHub is linked to our Slack chat, so we can get all the commit and issue activity there
- We also have a Trello, but it has become redundant now that we're using GitHub issue tracking


## Other decisions/conventions
- Eric is our scrum master, as it allows for consistant meetings that are done fairly quickly
