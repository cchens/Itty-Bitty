Itty Bitty: Bitwise arithmetic, possibly with a bit of binary/decimal/hexadecimal conversion

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators

We can use our own custom code to handle different bases (e.g. base 2 would be represented with “0b…”, base 16 would be “0x…”) and evaluate things (safely) in JavaScript.

Bitwise operators:
- NOT (~)
- AND (&)
- OR (|)
- XOR (^)

Bitwise shifts:
- Left shift (<<)
- Right shift (>>)
- Zero-fill right shift (>>>)

Skills:
- Masking
- Rotation
- Translating between bases

Probably worry about carry?
Performing operators and shifts with other bases? (e.g. 12 << 0b1 = 24, 0b1111 ^ 2 = 13)
